# 0x01. Developer tools

## Learning Objectives.

#### * What Developer Tools in your browser are
Developer tools are a suite and interface to test, rebuild, check and monitoring websites. The devtools panel allows you to edit HTML and CSS code and properties, a JS console, tabs for monitoring security, performance and accesibility, among other funcionalities 

#### * How to open the Developer Tools on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
In general, is just enough to click F12 button or with the right click option and Inspect element.
Also the key combination Ctrl + Shift + I (Command + Opt + I) is valid, too

#### * Holberton coding style: Betty
The C coding style of Holberton school is Betty coding style. It's inspired by the Linux Kernel coding style. Cloning the repository allows the installing option of Betty. Is executed as a command, being the first argument and followed by the files to be reviewed. Betty shows the line and the space of errors, if it's the case.\
See [Betty's Wiki](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki "Betty") Also, you can clone it

## Captain's log.
This section is dedicated to aha moments, some own troubleshooting, obvious things and knowledge for myself and others.
#### - README.md template
This is, for me, an academic template for all my README. Here I can use [links](about:blank), inline `code`
```c
Code snippets
```
And other shortcuts to write better README.
