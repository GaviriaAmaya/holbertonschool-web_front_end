# 0x01. Developer tools

## Learning Objectives.

#### * What Developer Tools in your browser are
Developer tools are a suite and interface to test, rebuild, check and monitoring websites. The devtools panel allows you to edit HTML and CSS code and properties, a JS console, tabs for monitoring security, performance and accesibility, among other funcionalities 

#### * How to open the Developer Tools on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
In general, is just enough to click F12 button or with the right click option and Inspect element.
Also the key combination Ctrl + Shift + I (Command + Opt + I) is valid, too

#### * How to use the elements tab to edit HTML and CSS
Normally, Elements tab is one of the first opened tabs that are opened when you inspect elements or just open Devtools. To edit any element just double clock on it or Right Click -> Edit option, too. Some keys have effect on the elements, for example `Supr`. Evidently, that key is to delete, so use it if you want to delete an element.
The editions are not permanent: When reload the site, it requests the sources from the server, so don't worry to edit any website 

#### * How to audit a page according to the tips suggested by Lighthouse
Lighthouse is a devtool that have it's own Devtools tab. Just click on the Lighthouse tab and click on 'Generate Report' button. I suggest that unable all the extensions from your browser, as they affects significatively the results. The report can be generated in different platforms and can be saved as different formats, from PDF to JSON.

#### * How to create and run snippets on a page
On Sources panel, you can click on the 'Snippets' tab. It allows you to add new code for the web page, and save it

#### * How to get information about files and server configurations


## Captain's log.
This section is dedicated to aha moments, some own troubleshooting, obvious things and knowledge for myself and others.
#### - README.md template
This is, for me, an academic template for all my README. Here I can use [links](about:blank), inline `code`
```c
Code snippets
```
And other shortcuts to write better README.
